How to Create a Phishing Simulation with GoPhish
Install GoPhish

Go to the GoPhish GitHub page.

Download the version that matches your operating system.

Extract the downloaded file to a folder of your choice.

Run the GoPhish program

Open your terminal, command prompt, or PowerShell.

Execute the GoPhish file (e.g., gophish.exe for Windows, ./gophish for Mac).

Make sure to note the URL where the admin panel is hosted.

Access the GoPhish Admin Panel

Open a web browser and navigate to the admin panel URL from the previous step.

Log in using the default credentials.

Update the password immediately for security.

Configure the SMTP settings

Go to the Sending Profiles page and create a new user profile.

Enter the SMTP server details, which can be Gmail, Mailtrap, or a custom server.

Test the connection to ensure emails can be sent.

Create your own Phishing email template

Navigate to the Email Templates page and select Create new template.

Write a realistic phishing email with a sneaky link (call to action).

Save this template for later use.

Create a fake landing page

Navigate to the Landing Page tab and create a new page.

Import a login page to make it look realistic.

Enable credential capture to log any credentials entered by users.

Add your targeted users

Go to Users and Groups and create a new group.

Add some test users by entering their email addresses.

Save the group to use later in the campaign.

Initiate the campaign

Navigate to Campaigns and select Create new campaign.

Select the email templates, landing page, sending profiles, and the targeted user group you created.

Set up the launch time and start the campaign.

Monitor the campaign results

Watch the dashboard to check the performance of your campaign.

Analyze metrics like email open rates, link clicks, and credentials entered.

Mark and note the users who fell for the campaign.

Create and provide training

Download the results from your campaign.

Contact friends and family who failed the test and teach them what to look for.

Repeat simulations later to see if there are any "repeat offenders" and who has learned from their mistakes.
